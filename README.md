# dataBowl
Data bowl for NUS Stats Soc study group 
gotta download the databowl data and extract it in a folder named databowl in the repo, then use the jupyter notebook to create the 
format. 
## NOTE
I will be using the fastai environment but I wont be using fastai package, because idw to fork the 
fastai repo(i dont wanna see the new changes to that repo man but i still want to use the fastai packages hmm) <br>
But some packages u gotta download for yourself. <br>
Working with databowl data, we will experience on ways to make the model better. 
Focusing on data analysis, we would work with the data to make find improvements for the model.
